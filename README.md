<h2 align="center">🎯A simple Artificial Intelligence model with the ability to diagnose Pneumonia using Convolutional Neural Network 🌟 
🔍 In this project, I have processed data consisting of X-ray images of a healthy chest and a chest with pneumonia and trained a convolutional model to predict and diagnose pneumonia.The results have been impressive, with good accuracy, and I'm excited to present them to you.</h2>
